It's based on 60 different aspects of societies that are relevant to democracy universal suffrage for all adults, voter participation, perception of human rights protection and freedom to form organizations and parties.
The democracy index is calculated from the 60 indicators, divided into five ""sub indexes"", which are:
1. Electoral pluralism index;
2. Government index;
3. Political participation indexm;
4. Political culture index;
5. Civil liberty index.
The sub-indexes are based on the sum of scores on roughly 12 indicators per sub-index, converted into a score between 0 and 100.
(The Economist publishes the index with a scale from 0 to 10, but Gapminder has converted it to 0 to 100 to make it easier to communicate as a percentage.)",Percent,governance,,,,,
